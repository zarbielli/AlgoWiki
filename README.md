# Questions

- How do we want to compare algorithms from diferent domains/family/variation?
    - They should be displayed separetaly, peharps with different colors for each category, and diferent lines of improvements or just displaying the dots of each algorithm.
    - 

- On individual family variation pages, what kind filter options we want to apply on the algorithms shown in the graph and list?
    Examples of filter options: 
        - Include Sequential algorithms
        - Include Parallel algorithms
        - Include WordRAM algorithms
        - Include PRAM algorithms
    We probably want a default view (initial filters apllied) and then the user can change what he want to see in the graph/list
    - Do we want to display algorithms of different categories with different colors?

- There is another kind of analysis/visualization that I could work on?
